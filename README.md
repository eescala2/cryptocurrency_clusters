## Analysis Overview

Purpose of the project is to take advantage of unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurriences from a database to create a report that includes crypotcurrencies that are classified according to their attributes. 
An example of this report can be used by an investment bank to propose a portfolio to some of its clients.
Methods in the analysis used are
* Preparing the database for analysis
* Reducing data dimensing using PCA (Principal Component Analaysis)
* Clustering Crypto with K-Means
* Visualizing results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
